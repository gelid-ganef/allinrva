        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Starting with a few small events during the pandemic
            to promote local beauty and wellness businesses, we've grown to 
            a small army of employees and volunteers, working to promote local
            craftspeople and service providers, and to give back to the local
            communities and local scenes we love! Our business and our private
            events all go back to supporting that mission.

        <h3>Our People</h3>
        <p>Proudly femme- and queer- owned and operated in Richmond, VA
            since 2020, our passion for diversity and inclusion is the reason
            why we do what we do! So we design our events around equity, accessibility,
            and inclusion, because we design parties our friends could come to.
            A party without exclusion. A party that's <em>All In!</em>

         has a broad skill set and diverse array of projects. But perhaps what defines her most is the
         deep dedication she applies to every passion project, whether it be running a group home,
         starting a gluten-free baking company, or planning her next concert adventure with a squad
         of friends.
